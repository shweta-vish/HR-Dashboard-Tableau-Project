# 📊 HR Analytics Dashboard – Tableau Project

Welcome to my HR Analytics project! This dashboard was built to provide HR professionals with powerful, interactive visual insights into workforce data — from employee demographics to income analysis.

## 👤 User Story

> As an HR manager, I want a comprehensive dashboard to analyze human resources data, providing both summary views for high-level insights and detailed employee records for in-depth analysis.

## 🔍 Project Overview

The dashboard is divided into three main sections:

### 1. **Overview**
- Total number of hired, active, and terminated employees
- Year-wise hiring and termination trends
- Department and job title breakdown
- HQ vs. Branch (New York as HQ) comparison
- Distribution of employees across cities and states

### 2. **Demographics**
- Gender ratio visualization
- Age group and education level breakdown
- Total employees by age and education
- Correlation between education and performance ratings

### 3. **Income Analysis**
- Salary comparisons by gender and education level
- Age vs. salary trends for different departments
